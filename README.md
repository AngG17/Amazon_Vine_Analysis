# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.  After the dataset was created, a determination is to be made as to whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.  For this analysis, I chose video games.

## Summary

51% of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars, compared to only 39% of non-Vine reviews having 5 stars.  This shows a positivity bias in Vine users when reviewing video games.  

An analysis of another type of product would be helpful to see if the same type of bias applies to other categories.  The interests and likes of a Vine user could influence the bias of a review, as they may be reviewing product they may not purchase on their own.
